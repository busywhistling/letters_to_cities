# Frankfurt
<p>Frankfurt (German: Frankfurt am Main) is the business and financial centre of
Germany and the largest city in the German state of Hesse. The city is known
for its futuristic skyline and the busiest German airport.</p>

<p>Located on the river Main, Frankfurt is the financial capital of Continental
Europe and the transportation centre of Germany. Frankfurt is home of the
European Central Bank and the German Stock Exchange. Furthermore, it hosts some
of the world's most important trade shows, such as the Frankfurt Auto Show and
the Frankfurt Book Fair.</p>

<p>Frankfurt is a city of contrasts. Wealthy bankers, students and granola
drop-outs coexist in a city that has some of the highest, most avant-garde
skyscrapers of Europe next to well maintained old buildings. The city centre,
especially RÃ¶mer square, the cultural landscape and the museums at the River
Main, draw millions of tourists every year. On the other hand, many off the
beaten track neighbourhoods, such as Bockenheim, Bornheim, Nordend and
Sachsenhausen, with their intact beautiful 19th century streets and parks are
often overlooked by visitors.</p>
