# Leipzig
<p>Leipzig is the largest city in the German federal state of Saxony, with a
population of approximately 560.000. It is the industrial center of the region
and a major cultural center, offering interesting sights, shopping
possibilities and lively nightlife.</p>

<p>First documented in 1015, and endowed with city and market privileges in 1165,
the city of Leipzig has fundamentally shaped the history of Saxony and of
Germany. It was founded at the crossing of two ancient trade routes, Via Regia
and Via Imperii. Leipzig has always been known as a place of commerce and still
has large trade fairgrounds and exhibition halls known as the Leipzig Messe and
located north of the city. Before it became common to dedicate a specific area
to trade fairs, they took place in the city itself. Which is why many of the
historical buildings were constructed by merchants, as well as Leipzig's unique
system of arcades and courtyards.</p>

<p>Other forms of exchange soon followed the trade of goods. The University of
Leipzig (latin: Alma mater lipsiensis) was founded in 1409, which makes it the
second-oldest university in Germany. University facilities are scattered
throughout the city, and you cannot miss the central campus at Augustusplatz
with the new main building.</p>

<p>Leipzig acquired the nickname Klein Paris ("Little Paris") in the 18th century,
when it became a center of a classical literary movement largely led by the
German scholar and writer Johann Christoph Gottsched.</p>

<p>The city is also the home of the Nikolaikirche (Church of St. Nicholas) â€“ the
starting point of peaceful demonstrations against the communist regime which
led to German Reunification. The collapse of communism hit Leipzig's economy
very heavily (as did communism itself), but after being on the mend for over
twenty years, it has emerged as one of the success stories of the "New German
States".</p>
