# Nuremberg
<p>Nuremberg (German: Nürnberg) is a city in the German state of Bavaria, in
the administrative region of Middle Franconia; it is Bavaria's second largest
city after Munich. It is situated on the Pegnitz river and the Main-Danube
Canal. It is located about 105 miles north of Munich, at 49.27° N 11.5° E.
Population (as of 31. January 2008) is 502,984. The town is also the Center of
the Metropolitan Region Nuremberg.</p>

<p>When people think of Nuremberg, they usually think of gingerbread, toys,
Christmas, the Nazi Party Rally Grounds or the Nuremberg Trials. The old town
of Nuremberg is much more than this and indeed Nuremberg probably comes closest
to many tourists' expectations of a typical German city: on the one hand one
can find half-timbered houses, gothic churches within a medieval city wall in
the shadow of the towering imperial castle, which was one of the most important
residences of the emperors of the Holy Roman Empire. On the other hand,
Nuremberg and the surrounding cities are home to many well-known German
companies, e.g. Adidas, Diehl, Faber-Castell, Playmobil, Puma and several
divisions of industrial giant Siemens. Finally, Nuremberg even can live up to
culinary expectations with breweries and beergardens and its most famous dish,
the Nuremberg sausages with Sauerkraut.</p>
