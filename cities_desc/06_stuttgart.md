# Stuttgart
Stuttgart is the capital of Baden-Württemberg, Germany, with a population of
approximately 635,000 in the immediate city and more than 2,5 million people in
the metropolitan area. 

Stuttgart was founded in the 10th century; its name is a modern version of the
original Stutengarten ("mare's garden"). Presently it is the 6th largest city
in Germany. It is most famous for its automotive industry (both Porsche and
Mercedes-Benz have their headquarters in Stuttgart and both have car museums)
as well as its mineral springs in the district of Bad Cannstatt which owns the
second largest source of mineral water in Europe after Budapest. Also, it is
Germany's city with the largest vineyard area.

Stuttgarters are amazingly friendly people who will forgive you if German isn't
your first or second (or any) language. If you do speak German well: beware
that many people speak the local Schwäbisch dialect natively which may somewhat
affect their standard German - which however everyone can speak. Stuttgart is a
big city with a small-town atmosphere.
