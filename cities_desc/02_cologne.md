# Cologne
<p>Cologne (German: Köln) is situated on the river Rhine, it's the largest city in
North Rhine-Westphalia and the fourth largest city in Germany with more than
1.000.000 inhabitants (greater area <3.500.000 inhabitans). In medieval times
it was the largest city of the Holy Roman Empire. It is one of the nation's
media, tourism and business hotspots. Cologne is known to be one of the most
liberal cities in Germany.</p>

<p>The distinctive flavour to the city of Cologne is often linked to the city's
inhabitants, or Kölsche, who take an enormous amount of pride in their city.
English-speaking guides and information are available for many of the landmarks
of the city. For tourists who speak German and wish to practice it, the
citizens usually have a lot of patience with those trying to come to grips with
the language. Cologne's citizens are very friendly and jovial people, welcoming
tourists of all types and with all interests.</p>

<p>Away from the landmarks, workers of the Deutsche Bahn (German railways) often
speak English reasonably well, and ticket machines have a language selection
feature. In general, older people in Cologne tend to have little or no
knowledge of English, while younger Germans and those working in the business
world tend to be reasonably proficient. Language is rarely a strong barrier, so
this shouldn't be too much of a worry for the average tourist. Just approach a
friendly native and use a smile on your face.</p>

<p>Cologne has an excellent public transport network consisting of trams, local
trains and buses. Bicycles are also available for hire on the northern side of
the Hauptbahnhof. Local transport systems rarely provide announcements in
English, but network maps are commonly available to assist with your journey.
Those wishing to explore area away from the central city should plan their
journey and potential connections before leaving. The KVB (Kölner
Verkehrs-Betriebe) website is a good source of public transport information.</p>
